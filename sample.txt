Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines.
AI is used in many fields including healthcare, finance, and education.
Machine learning is a subset of AI that learns from data without being explicitly programmed.
Deep learning uses neural networks with many layers to solve complex problems.
Natural language processing (NLP) allows computers to understand human language.
Large language models like GPT and Claude are trained on vast amounts of text data.
RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation. It combines search with language generation.
RAG helps language models answer questions using your own documents instead of just training data.
Vector databases store embeddings and allow fast similarity search.
ChromaDB is an open-source vector database that runs locally on your machine.
